# EngagementCulture

This repository exists to further research on the topic of Engagement Culture, which is the shared underlying assumption that intrinsic motivation creates energy that drives growth (Wang & Degol, 2014) and that dissatisfaction depresses that energy (Herzberg, 2011). The best way to motivate is by increasing satisfaction and decreasing dissatisfaction—not by coercion into compliance. 

The concstruct started as a study for Laura Hearnsberger's doctoral dissertation for Pepperdine University, in an attempt to clarify the notion that school culture could help overcome obstacles to academic performance faced by high-poverty schools. The problem that the study sought to solve was determining what is meant by culture and how schools should shape it to manifest improved academic performance. Even though organizational culture is widely accepted as essential for achieving sustainable success (Kotter & Heskett, 1992; Jung, et al., 2009; Deal & Peterson, 2016; U. S. Department of Education, 2019), what is meant by culture varies (Jung et al., 2009), and identifying culture qualities to improve academic performance is elusive (M.-T. Wang & Degol, 2016).

The purpose of the non-experimental, cross-sectional study was to identify specific characteristics of culture that correlate with academic achievement in high-poverty schools. Research around student engagement, hidden culture, drivers of beliefs and actions, and motivation provideed the backdrop for this study. 

"Culture" has a lot of different meanings, each one correct, depending on the context. Schools tend to operationalize "culture" as how well-behaved and quiet its students are (Marquez, 2019). Check out the Texas Education Agency's Effective School Framework resources called "Mission, Vision and Values Artifacts" and "Student Rollout: Schoolwide Culture Routine" (https://texasesf.org/esf-in-action/#3.1). 

We define and study culture as shared underlying assumptions. Our definition combines ideas from Deal & Peterson (2016) and Schein & Schein (2017). Deal & Peterson say that culture is the “shared webbing of beliefs, informal folkways, and traditions that infuse work with meaning, passion, and purpose” (p. 2). Schein & Schein say it comprises three levels: artifacts, espoused beliefs and values, and basic underlying assumptions (p. 18). 

We study basic underlying assumptions, because they drive behavior. The ladder of inference, based on the work of Chris Argyris (1976), is the internal series of steps from observing data to taking action——the only two steps visible to outside observers. Steps include (a) observe data and experiences; (b) select data chosen from step one; (c) assign meanings to select data; (d) make assumptions based on the meanings; (e) draw conclusions from those assumptions; (f) adopt beliefs in light of the conclusions; and (g) take actions based on beliefs (Senge et al., 1994).

Cultural norms inform the shared meanings, assumptions, and beliefs that drive action. If the cultural assumption is that coercion is the best motivator, then coercive behavior will occur. The cultural assumption that coercion is the best way to motivate leads to systemic compliance and disengagement, not a culture of engagement.

From Schlechty (2011) and Senge (2006): (ul)

  --Cultures that believe in positive or carrot coercion to motivate will produce genuine compliance and likely meet expectations.
  
  --Cultures that believe in negative or whip coercion to motivate will produce disengagement and defiance.
  
  --Cultures that believe in intrinsic motivation to motivate will produce engagement and robust, lasting learning.

It is still in its early stages, but the vision is for this to be a place where researchers can find data, literature, topics, problem statements, and methods to support the study and proliferation of engagement culture.

# EngagementCulture

This repository exists to further research on the topic of Engagement Culture, which is the shared underlying assumption that intrinsic motivation creates energy that drives growth (Wang & Degol, 2014) and that dissatisfaction depresses that energy (Herzberg, 2011). **The best way to motivate is by increasing satisfaction and decreasing dissatisfaction—not by coercion into compliance.**

The engagement culture construct started as a study for Laura Hearnsberger's (2021) doctoral dissertation for Pepperdine University, in an attempt to clarify the notion that school culture could help overcome obstacles to academic performance faced by high-poverty schools. The problem that the study sought to solve was determining what is meant by culture and how schools should shape it to manifest improved academic performance. Even though organizational culture is widely accepted as essential for achieving sustainable success (Kotter & Heskett, 1992; Jung, et al., 2009; Deal & Peterson, 2016; U. S. Department of Education, 2019), what is meant by culture varies (Jung et al., 2009), and identifying culture qualities to improve academic performance is elusive (M.-T. Wang & Degol, 2016).

**The purpose** of the non-experimental, cross-sectional study was to identify specific characteristics of culture that correlate with academic achievement in high-poverty schools. Research around student engagement, hidden culture, drivers of beliefs and actions, and motivation provideed the backdrop for this study. 

**"Culture" has a lot of different meanings**, each one correct, depending on the context. Schools tend to operationalize "culture" as how well-behaved and quiet its students are (Marquez, 2019). Check out the Texas Education Agency's Effective School Framework resources called "Mission, Vision and Values Artifacts" and "Student Rollout: Schoolwide Culture Routine" (https://texasesf.org/esf-in-action/#3.1). 

**We define and study culture as shared underlying assumptions.** Our definition combines ideas from Deal & Peterson (2016) and Schein & Schein (2017). Deal & Peterson say that culture is the “shared webbing of beliefs, informal folkways, and traditions that infuse work with meaning, passion, and purpose” (p. 2). Schein & Schein say it comprises three levels: artifacts, espoused beliefs and values, and basic underlying assumptions (p. 18). 

**We study basic underlying assumptions, because they drive behavior.** The ladder of inference, based on the work of Chris Argyris (1976), is the internal series of steps from observing data to taking action——the only two steps visible to outside observers. Steps include (a) observe data and experiences; (b) select data chosen from step one; (c) assign meanings to select data; (d) make assumptions based on the meanings; (e) draw conclusions from those assumptions; (f) adopt beliefs in light of the conclusions; and (g) take actions based on beliefs (Senge et al., 1994).

Cultural norms inform the shared meanings, assumptions, and beliefs that drive action. If the cultural assumption is that coercion is the best motivator, then coercive behavior will occur. **The cultural assumption that coercion is the best way to motivate leads to systemic compliance and disengagement, not a culture of engagement.**

These ideas from organizational experts Schlechty (2011) and Senge (2006) demonstrate how coercion can have unintended consequences:
  * Cultures that believe in **positive or carrot coercion** to motivate will **produce genuine compliance and likely meet expectations.**
  * Cultures that believe in **negative or whip coercion** to motivate will **produce disengagement and defiance.**
  * Cultures that believe in **intrinsic motivation** to motivate will **produce engagement and robust, lasting learning.**

Herzberg (2011) is an expert on motivation within organizations. He suggests that motivation has two distinct aspects: Intrinsic motivators that **increase satisfaction** and Maintenance factors that **minimize *dis*satisfaction**.

**Intrinsic motivators that increase satisfaction**
  * Achievement
  * Recognition for achievement
  * The work itself
  * Responsibility
  * Growth or advancement

**Maintenance factors that minimize dissatisfaction**
  * Company policy and administration
  * Supervision
  * Interpersonal relationships
  * Working conditions
  * Salary
  * Status
  * Security

**The original study** measured relationships among culture, motivation, and academic performance. Evidence of high intrinsic motivation and low coercion within these relationships would indicate the presence of engagement culture (Goleman, 2011; Schlecty, 2011; and Senge, 2006). 

**The target population** was urban, high-poverty public school campuses. The representative sample comprised 172 high-poverty public school campuses in Dallas ISD. Dallas ISD was selected because of its large size, the availability of valid and reliable engagement culture data for each campus, and the demographic makeup of its urban, high-poverty campuses, which has similar demographics to other urban, high-poverty campuses in the United States.

**Data.** There were no direct participants. Aggregate campus-level data were from school year 2019 and came from the Texas Education Agency & Dallas ISD. Those data (and additional as gathered) will be posted in this repository. 

**Analysis.** Hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted for each outcome variable to determine to what extent the presence of predictor variables explains extra variation in each outcome variable.

**Predictor Variables**
* Released Data from Dallas ISD
  * Select staff engagement and support survey items percent positive
  * Overall composite rates of positive results from parent surveys
  * Overall composite rates of positive results from student surveys
  * Extracurricular participation rates
* Released Data from the Texas Education Agency 
  * Discretionary discipline rates
  * Population discipline rates

**Outcome Variables**
* Released Data from The Texas Education Agency
  * Domain II: Academic Growth whole points awarded
  * Domain II: Relative Performance STAAR-only scale scores

**Significant Findings and Important Trends**
**Research Question One:** How much do culture construct scores indicating intrinsic motivation and minimal dissatisfaction, discipline data indicating non-coercive motivation styles, and extracurricular participation explain a campus’ academic growth?
**Null Hypothesis:** Engagement culture is not related to academic growth in high-poverty schools.
There was a statistically significant relationship between factors of engagement culture and academic growth in high-poverty schools. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis.

**Research Question Two:** How much do culture construct scores indicating intrinsic motivation and minimal dissatisfaction, discipline data indicating non-coercive motivation styles, and extracurricular participation rates explain a campus’ relative academic performance?
**Null Hypothesis:** Engagement culture is not related to relative academic performance in high-poverty schools.
There was a statistically significant relationship between factors of engagement culture and relative academic performance in high-poverty schools. Therefore, we can reject the null hypothesis.

**Conclusions**
**Conclusion 1:** Engagement Culture Explains Academic Growth on High-Poverty Campuses. Student satisfaction (r(145) = .51, p < .001) and the expectation by teachers that students would attend college (r(145) = .52, p < .001) were each more strongly related to academic growth than poverty rate, which did not have a statistically significant relationship with growth on high-poverty campuses, r = -.03, p = .71.

**Conclusion 2:** Engagement Culture Explains Relative Academic Performance on High-Poverty Campuses. Student satisfaction (r(145) = .44, p < .001) and the expectation by teachers that students would attend college (r(145) = .55, p < .001) were each more strongly related to relative academic performance than poverty rate, r= -.23, p < .005.

It is still in its early stages, but the vision is for this to be a place where researchers can find data, literature, topics, problem statements, and methods to support the study and proliferation of engagement culture.

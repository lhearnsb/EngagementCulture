This SQL query was used to join data about all campuses in the US in 2019 and create a base file of all campuses.

Note that there are some discrepancies in the reporting from different states, either because of differences in rules or user error. More detail at bottom.
This query attempts to create an "apples to apples" set of data on campuses throughout the US.

It uses the following datasets:

NCES_Membership2019, aka Membership from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp#Fiscal:2,LevelId:7,SchoolYearId:33,Page:1
NCES_Lunch2019, aka Lunch Program Eligibility from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp#Fiscal:2,LevelId:7,SchoolYearId:33,Page:1
NCES_Characteristics2019, aka School Characteristics from https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/files.asp#Fiscal:2,LevelId:7,SchoolYearId:33,Page:1
EDGE_Geocode2019, aka 2018-2019 Public School File from https://nces.ed.gov/programs/edge/Geographic/SchoolLocations


```
--This is the base build. The question is... why do some schools have over a 100% free/reduced lunch rate? Should we just use the direct cert if a campus has both?

--66 schools have more free/reduced lunch recipients than students enrolled.
----53 of these are from Alaska. The 13 other represent Floria (1); Guam (2); Utah (8); and Washington (2)
----Most (34) are off by 1 or 2. Eight are off by 3. Two are off by 4. Twelve are off by between 5 and 9.
----Ten are off by 11 or more. All of these are from Alaska.
----Some are extreme. Fairview Elementary (020018000076) in Anchorage School District is over by 113.
------These unexpected numbers are verified using the NCES map here: https://data-nces.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/public-school-characteristics-2018-19?geometry=159.474%2C62.072%2C-140.760%2C68.471&orderBy=OBJECTID&orderByAsc=false&selectedAttribute=LEAID
------It is unclear why Alaska has these discrepanices. 
------According to https://www.thedailymeal.com/eat/free-school-lunch-breakfast-every-state/slide-7, 
------Alaska has the same qualification requirements, although they are reimbursed more per meal due to the cost of food
--------"The NSLP reimburses Alaska schools for meals at a higher rate than any other state because of higher food costs on 
---------the Last Frontier â€” in 2018-19, schools in the state received $5.38 for each free meal served, as compared to $3.31 
---------in the 48 contiguous states. Eligibility rules for students, however, match the federal standard."
